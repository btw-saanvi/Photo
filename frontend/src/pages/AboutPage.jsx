              <h3>Can I use this on mobile?</h3>

            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">

              <p>Absolutely! We've listened to your requests, and now you can personalize your photo strip with custom border colors, sticker overlays, date overlays, and even change the logo.</p>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>Why is the screen black even after allowing camera access?</h3>
              <p>Your camera permissions might be blocked. Go to: Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera</p>
              <p>Turn on: "Let apps access your camera" and "Let desktop apps access your camera".</p>
            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>Why does my camera feed start black?</h3>
              <p>That's intentional! The app waits until you accept camera permissions before displaying the video feed.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>Do you store my photos or data?</h3>
              <p>Nope! Your photos stay on your device and never get uploaded or stored anywhere. Everything happens locally in your browser, so you have full control over your images.</p>
